# 🍓 Reinforcement Learning – Custom FrozenLake 10x10 with Bonus Mode

This project explores **Reinforcement Learning** using a **customized FrozenLake environment (10x10)** with two gameplay modes, including a **bonus Strawberry Mode** that encourages richer strategies through reward shaping.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The agent is trained using **Q-Learning** to reach the goal with the most optimal path while avoiding holes. To make the learning more interesting, a bonus mode introduces strawberries on the map, which give **extra rewards** when collected.

### 🎮 Modes

- **Normal Mode**  
  Classic FrozenLake-style grid. The agent must find a safe path to the goal while avoiding holes.

- **Strawberry Mode 🍓**  
  Strawberries are randomly placed on the map. Each one gives **additional rewards** when the agent steps on it, influencing its decision-making and exploration.

## 📦 Features

- 🔸 Custom 10x10 FrozenLake environment
- 🔸 Q-Learning implementation from scratch
- 🔸 Reward shaping with collectibles (strawberries)
- 🔸 Visualization and video demo of agent behavior
- 🔸 Two modes: standard & bonus

## 📹 Demo
